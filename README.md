# Barcode-QR-Generator
## This webapp Generates, Scans, Reads Barcode and QR code.

Both QR codes and barcodes store information about an item or product in a machine-readable format that can be easily scanned with a barcode scanner or, more recently, many smartphones (when equipped with a barcode-scanning app or QR code reader). Using QR codes is a great way to streamline the user experience and ensure customers can access information as quickly and efficiently as possible. By scanning a QR code, customers can go straight to a landing page or check-in at a location without having to speak to a staff member or ask for support. Nowadays it is widely used in online payment.
